## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Click on the top right green "code" button.
- On the dropdown menu, choose "download with zip" button.
- After download, extract the zip file and you have the project on your machine.
- Make sure that your PostgreSQL server is running and you have the ability to establish connection with the database.
- Create a new file called `local_env.yml` in the folder `config/` and paste the following code in it:
  > `PG_USERNAME: "YourPostgresUsername"`<br> `PG_PASSWORD: "YourPostgresPassword"` <br> `GMAIL_USERNAME: "YourGmailSenderUsername"`<br> `GMAIL_PASS: "YourGmailSenderPassword"`<br>
  > Note:<br> You can use your own gmail account to send emails but first you have to configure 2-Step Authorization and after that you have to configure
  > an APP Password for this specific application. If you want more information about this, GOOGLE IT.
- Execute `rails db:create` to create the database.
- Run `rails s` to run the application.

## Tests

- If you want to run some unit tests, all you need to do is:
- On your terminal execute:
  > `gem install rspec`
NOTE: THIS IS IMPORTANT!
- Execute the seed on the database environment TEST: 
  > `rails RAILS_ENV=test db:seed`

After that, you can run the tests by executing the following steps:
- Run the `rspec` command in this case over the path of `spec/yourspecificfolderwithtests`, the resulting command will look like this:
  > `rspec spec/models/your_model_spec.rb`
- If you want to run the tests over the entire project, you can execute the following command:
  > `rspec spec/`
